# Forecasting Energy demand using Machine Learning
![image](img0.png)
This repository contains the code for predicting the half-hourly electricity demand for Victoria, Australia. With the use of skforecast library, I did a thorough evaluation using techniques :
- Recursive forecasting
- Backtesting
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Exogenous variables
- Prediction interval 
- Feature selection
